# Buiding Abstractions with data

In this chapter we are going to look at more complex data. Programs are typically designed to model complex phenomena, and more often than  not one must construct computational objects that have several parts in order to model real-world  phenomena that have several aspects.  we turn in this chapter to another key aspect of  any programming language: the means it provides for building abstractions by combining data objects to  form **compound data**
