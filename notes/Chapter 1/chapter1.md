##  1.1 The Elements of Programming

A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks.we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for  combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for  accomplishing this: 

- **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with 
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and 
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
